# Phase 15 Acceptance Plan (Design Only)

This plan validates the complete controlled self-service design lifecycle
without execution tooling.

## End-to-end lifecycle (design-only)

1. Tenant submits a proposal and runs validation.
2. Operator approves with constraints and records evidence.
3. Delegation is granted for future proposals (design-only).
4. Tenant requests a time-boxed exception.
5. Exception expires and is reviewed with evidence.

## Evidence expectations

- Proposal bundle references.
- Approval and delegation records.
- Exception request, approval, and expiry evidence.

## Expected outcomes

- Governance model clarifies ownership and review cadence.
- Risk ledger concept is documented for future audits.
- Exceptions remain time-boxed and evidence-backed.
- No execution or automation is introduced.

## PASS/FAIL criteria

PASS if:
- All Phase 15 design docs exist and are consistent.
- Governance and exception handling are explicit.
- No automation or policy relaxation is introduced.

FAIL if:
- Any required doc is missing.
- Exceptions imply permanent policy bypass.
- Execution paths are added.
