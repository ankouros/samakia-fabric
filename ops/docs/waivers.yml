waivers:
  - name: substrate.plan.ci
    reason: CI-only target; operators use substrate.plan instead.
  - name: phase11.entry.check
    reason: Design-phase governance check; referenced in phase docs instead of cookbook.
  - name: bindings.verify.live
    reason: Live verification is guarded and optional; offline mode is the canonical default.
