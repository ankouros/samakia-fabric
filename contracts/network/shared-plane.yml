# Shared SDN plane contract for internal services.
shared_plane:
  zone: zshared
  vnet: vshared
  vlan: 120
  purpose: >
    Single internal shared infrastructure plane.
    Hosts foundational platform services.
  rules:
    - all internal services MUST attach here
    - no service-specific zones allowed
    - no tenant workloads allowed
    - isolation is logical (policy), not SDN-based

legacy_zones:
  - zone: zonedns
    vnet: vlandns
    vlan: 100
    status: legacy
    notes: >
      Legacy DNS plane. Do not extend; migrate to zshared/vshared.
  - zone: zminio
    vnet: vminio
    vlan: 140
    status: legacy
    notes: >
      Legacy MinIO plane. Do not extend; migrate to zshared/vshared.

prohibited_patterns:
  - creating zones named after services (e.g. zminio, zonedns)
  - creating vnets for internal services
