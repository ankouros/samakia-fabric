# Operator Docs

This directory is the **canonical operator UX surface** for Samakia Fabric.

Start here:
- `cookbook.md` — task-oriented command recipes (copy/paste)
- `cookbook.md` includes the Phase 1–12 milestone verification and lock tasks
- `phase12-exposure.md` — one-page Phase 12 exposure flow
- `safety-model.md` — read-only default, execute guards, evidence posture
- `evidence-and-artifacts.md` — where evidence and artifacts live
- `glossary.md` — operator terms used across runbooks

For consumer workflows, see:
- `../consumers/catalog.md`
- `../consumers/quickstart.md`
