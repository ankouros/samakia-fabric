# Tenant bindings

Tenant bindings connect Phase 10 workloads to Phase 11 substrate endpoints.
Bindings are **contract-only** and **operator-controlled**. They never create
infrastructure or secrets.

See:
- `docs/bindings/secrets.md`
- `docs/bindings/verification.md`
- `docs/operator/cookbook.md` (canonical commands)
