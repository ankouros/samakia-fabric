# Self-Service Governance Model (Phase 15 Part 5 — Design)

This document defines long-term ownership and governance for controlled
self-service. It is design-only.

## Ownership and roles

- **Platform governance** owns the self-service policy baseline.
- **Operators** enforce approvals, execution, and guardrails.
- **Tenants** provide intent and scope but do not execute changes.

## Authority

- Autonomy levels can change only by governance decision.
- Exceptions require explicit approval and evidence.
- Policy changes require review and written rationale.

## Review cadence

- Governance review occurs on a fixed cadence (e.g., quarterly).
- Reviews include risk ledger trends and audit findings.

## Required evidence

- Policy change proposals with impact assessment.
- Approval records and signatures for prod changes.
- Evidence links for incidents and deviations.

## Statement

Self-service governance is slower than feature development by design.
