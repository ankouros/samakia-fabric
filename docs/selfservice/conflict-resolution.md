# Self-Service Conflict Resolution (Phase 15 Part 4 — Design)

This document defines how to resolve disputes between tenants and operators
in a controlled, auditable way.

## Disagreement handling

- Operators provide a clear denial reason with evidence.
- Tenants may submit a revised proposal with new rationale.
- Repeated disputes trigger escalation.

## Escalation path

1. Operator review and feedback.
2. Escalation to platform governance lead.
3. Formal review with evidence and risk summary.

## Cooling-off period

- Introduce a cooling-off window after repeated denials.
- Prevents repeated requests that erode operator focus.

## Final authority

- Operator decisions stand unless governance overrides them.
- Platform safety always wins over convenience.

## Statement

Conflict resolution is evidence-driven and preserves guardrails.
