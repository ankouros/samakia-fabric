# Self-Service Exceptions Framework (Phase 15 Part 5 — Design)

Exceptions allow time-boxed deviations without eroding policy.
This is design-only.

## What counts as an exception

- Temporary policy deviations for critical business need.
- Time-boxed scope expansion under operator oversight.

## Request and approval

- Tenants may request exceptions with explicit rationale.
- Operators can recommend, governance must approve.
- Exceptions require written scope and expiration.

## Mandatory requirements

- Expiration date and time window.
- Evidence-backed approval with identity fields.
- Post-exception review and remediation notes.

## Explicitly forbidden

- Permanent exceptions.
- Undocumented overrides.
- Silent policy drift.

## Statement

Exceptions are rare, time-boxed, and audited by default.
