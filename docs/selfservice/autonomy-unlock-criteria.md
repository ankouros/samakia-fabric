# Autonomy Unlock Criteria (Phase 15 Part 4 — Design)

This document defines **future-only** criteria for advancing autonomy levels.
Unlocking autonomy is a governance decision, not a technical toggle.

## Level 0 → Level 1 (Design Only)

All of the following must be true:

- Sustained SLO compliance over a defined window.
- Zero critical incidents in the same window.
- Stable drift history with no unresolved violations.
- Successful audit of proposal evidence and decisions.
- Explicit operator sign-off recorded in evidence.

## Level 1 → Level 2 (Design Only)

All of the following must be true:

- Longer sustained SLO compliance across peak periods.
- Zero critical incidents across multiple windows.
- Consistent drift stability with no high-risk changes.
- Successful governance review and audit sign-off.
- Operator leadership approval with change window policy.

## Non-negotiables

- Unlock criteria never auto-trigger.
- Any unlock decision requires explicit evidence.

## Statement

Autonomy unlocks are governance decisions, not technical defaults.
